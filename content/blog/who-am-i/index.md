description: A short primer on who I am, what my interests are, and what you can expect to find if you choose to spend your valuable time navigating my blog.

My name is Fahim Faisal, and I _really_ love my name. If you have known me
personally for even a day over a year, you know that I cannot possibly claim
Computer Science to be a _life long_ passion. Indeed, before both my application
cycles to the United States failed miserably, I had wanted to pursue Physics,
with a concentration on quantum physics. But alas, life had its way against me,
and I was stuck here, with CS as a hastily chosen major.

Looking back, I couldn't be more grateful.

Ofcourse, I do not imply that I'm okay with all the college rejections. If I
was given the choice to go back and have an acceptance only to pursue physics,
I would still take it up in a heartbeat. No, the rejections are not the part
that I'm grateful about. Rather, it is about the fact that I ended up choosing
CS as my _next best alternative_. The way that this field mesmerizes me day in
and day out is simply beyond my ability to describe in the words that I know.

If I'm being honest, it is also overwhelming sometimes. There are so many things
to explore, and I'm but an average person with the same 24 hours in his day as
everyone else. One moment, I will find myself studying indexes in the realm of
databases, and in the very next, I will be studying the code in the Bitcoin core
implementation to learn more about how to create cryptocurrencies. While I don't
have a problem digesting all these information, I do find it troublesome to
_index_ them in my own brain - to bring them into a cohesive framework that
allows me to look at the field from a forest-through-the-trees perspective.

And this is what this blog is about, dear reader. It is a product for my own
benefit, to help me organize my thoughts around the many facets of CS by writing
extensively about them here. And just like my disarrayed thoughts, you'll see
all the blog posts here vary wildly in their topic and content: some
will be dense with code and low-level implementation details of things, while
others will be about higher-level concepts, ideas, and methodologies. Some will
be about the most recent fad, like blockchains, while others will be about
disciplines that have been around since the invention of the first computer.

So, do you have nothing of interest here? Actually, as I keep writing, more
and more of you will find things of value here. Whatever I write about, I will
write about it in depth, which some of you may find really helpful. However,
given the reason for this blog's existence, you may not always find continuations
of something when you want it, because I may have moved on to other things.
Regardless, just consider hopping on in this journey with me, and explore all
the wonderful things that CS has to offer!
